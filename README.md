`Machine Learning Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection`


This repository contains code and data for detecting cyberattacks using machine learning techniques. The focus is on building and evaluating a Random Forest classifier to identify intrusion attempts based on [network traffic data ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287330529_UNSW-NB15_a_comprehensive_data_set_for_network_intrusion_detection_systems_UNSW-NB15_network_data_set)generated by the Cyber Range Lab at UNSW Canberra, Australia.

`Model Performance:`


The Random Forest model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

- Accuracy: 95.24%
- Recall: 93.07%
- Precision: 98.99%

`Features:`

- Model Training: Includes code for training the Random Forest model.
- Data Preprocessing: Includes code for encoding categorical variables
- Evaluation: Includes code for evaluating the model using various performance metrics and visualizing feature importances.
